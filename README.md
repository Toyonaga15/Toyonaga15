Welcome to my page everyone!

I am an economist with a passion for the financial market and am constantly seeking to learn more about using Python for exploratory data analysis in finance. I believe that my background and programming skills allow me to have a unique and innovative perspective on market data and make informed decisions. I am always excited to apply my knowledge and skills to better understand the financial market and its movements.
